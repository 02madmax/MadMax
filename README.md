# MadMax
This is my first website. Here I am demonstrating my abiltiy to use HTML and CSS fluently. I struggled with many different css elements and will try to correct and revise this code over the course of the class

## Contributions
I used many different sources for this code, it is ultimately combined with everything we learned in the advanced css portion and html. Comments or contributions to correct bugs in the code would be greatly appreciated.

## Purpose
The purpose of this code is for me to display all of my coding skills and showcase my own personal future portfolio. I will be adding more work to it soon.
